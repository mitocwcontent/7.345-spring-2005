Project 1
---------

You will be given a scientific paper without its title and abstract. You will be asked to write an abstract (no more than 250 words) and a title.

Project 2
---------

Toward the end of the semester, you will be asked to write a 3-page research proposal (double-spaced, font size 12) about one of the topics discussed at the seminar. The proposal will consist of a summary of the background, a testable hypothesis and a couple of experiments (with crucial controls) to test this hypothesis. You will be asked to present your proposal during the last session.
